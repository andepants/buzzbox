# Epic 3: Group Chat

**Phase:** Day 2-3 (Extended Messaging)
**Priority:** P1 (High - Core Feature)
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
**Epic Owner:** Development Team Lead
**Dependencies:** Epic 2 (One-on-One Chat Infrastructure)

---

## ‚úÖ CODEBASE READINESS (Updated: 2025-10-21)

**All prerequisite fixes have been applied to the codebase:**
- ‚úÖ `ConversationEntity` extended with `adminUserIDs: [String]` and `groupPhotoURL`
- ‚úÖ `MessageEntity` extended with `isSystemMessage: Bool` and `readBy: [String: Date]`
- ‚úÖ RTDB rules updated with group validation (admin permissions, participant limits, system messages)
- ‚úÖ `ConversationService.syncConversation()` syncs all group fields to RTDB
- ‚úÖ Storage rules added for `/group_photos/{groupId}/` path
- ‚úÖ `StorageService.uploadGroupPhoto()` method added for group photo uploads

**Security Enhancements:**
- ‚úÖ Only admins can modify `groupName`, `groupPhotoURL`, and `participantList` (enforced by RTDB rules)
- ‚úÖ Participant limits enforced: min 2, max 256 (RTDB validation)
- ‚úÖ System messages validated: `senderID` must be "system" if `isSystemMessage == true`
- ‚úÖ Read receipts support timestamps: `readBy: { "userID": timestamp }`

**Implementation Ready:** This epic is now ready for Story 3.1 implementation.

## MVP Completion Stories (Added: 2025-10-22)

**Context:** The following three stories address gaps identified during Product Owner review against core messaging requirements. All three are **P0 (MVP Blockers)** and must be completed before TestFlight deployment.

**Total Additional Time:** 2 hours 15 minutes

---

### Story 3.10: Read Receipts for One-on-One Conversations
**As a user, I want to see read receipts in 1:1 chats so I know when my message has been read.**

**Priority:** P0 (MVP Blocker)
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Complexity:** Low (extend existing group read receipt infrastructure)

**Gap Analysis:**
- ‚ùå **Current:** Read receipts ONLY work in groups (`MessageBubbleView:37` requires `conversation.isGroup`)
- ‚úÖ **Expected:** WhatsApp-style double blue checkmark for all conversations (1:1 and groups)
- üìä **Impact:** Users cannot see if their 1:1 messages have been read

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Double checkmark turns blue when recipient reads message (1:1 chats)
- [ ] Read status updates in real-time (RTDB listener)
- [ ] Read status persists across app restarts (SwiftData)
- [ ] Tapping read checkmark shows "Message Info" sheet with timestamp
- [ ] Works offline: read status queued and synced when online
- [ ] VoiceOver announces "Read" status for accessibility

**Technical Tasks:**

1. **Update MessageBubbleView.swift** (1 line change at line 37):
   ```swift
   /// Check if read receipts can be shown (own messages in all conversations)
   private var canShowReadReceipts: Bool {
       isFromCurrentUser && !message.isSystemMessage
       // ‚úÖ Removed: && conversation.isGroup
   }
   ```

2. **Update ReadReceiptsView.swift** (~40 lines):
   - Add `conversation: ConversationEntity` parameter
   - Create `oneOnOneReadReceiptView` for single recipient
   - Show "Message Info" with Sent/Delivered/Read timestamps
   - Format:
     - Sent: [timestamp]
     - Delivered: ‚úì or "Pending"
     - Read: [timestamp] or "Not yet"

3. **Verify MessageService.swift**:
   - Existing `listenToReadReceipts()` already works for 1:1 and groups
   - Verify RTDB rules allow `/messages/{conversationID}/{messageID}/readBy/{userID}` writes

4. **Verify MessageThreadView.swift** (line 227):
   - Existing `markVisibleMessagesAsRead()` should work for 1:1
   - Writes to `message.readBy[currentUserID] = Date()`
   - Syncs to RTDB via `MessageService.shared.markMessageAsRead()`

**Testing Standards:**

**Manual Testing:**
- [ ] User A sends message to User B (1:1 chat)
- [ ] User A sees single checkmark (sent)
- [ ] User B opens conversation
- [ ] User A sees double gray checkmark (delivered)
- [ ] User B scrolls to message (marks as read)
- [ ] User A sees double BLUE checkmark (read)
- [ ] User A taps checkmark ‚Üí "Message Info" sheet shows read timestamp
- [ ] Offline test: B reads while A is offline ‚Üí sync when A reconnects

**Regression Testing:**
- [ ] Group read receipts still work (multi-recipient)
- [ ] Long press in groups shows "Read By" list
- [ ] System messages don't show read receipts

**References:**
- Story 3.6 (Group Read Receipts) - extend to 1:1
- UX Design Doc Section 4.3 (Message Thread - Read Receipts)
- Implementation Plan: See detailed breakdown above

### Story 3.11: Send Image Attachments in Messages
**As a user, I want to attach images to messages so I can share photos with friends.**

**Priority:** P0 (MVP Blocker)
**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
**Complexity:** Medium (UI + backend integration)

**Gap Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **Exists:** AttachmentEntity model, StorageService.uploadImage()
- ‚ùå **Missing:** MessageComposerView has NO photo button
- ‚ùå **Missing:** No UI to select/preview images
- üìä **Impact:** Users cannot send photos (core messaging feature missing)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] "+" button in MessageComposerView opens iOS photo picker
- [ ] User selects photo from library (NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription permission)
- [ ] Selected photo shows thumbnail preview with file size
- [ ] User can remove photo before sending
- [ ] Photo uploads to Firebase Storage with progress indicator (0-100%)
- [ ] Message sends with image attachment after upload completes
- [ ] Attachment persists in SwiftData (offline queue)
- [ ] Failed uploads show retry button with specific error message
- [ ] Photos compressed before upload (max 2MB, JPEG quality 0.8)
- [ ] Works offline: uploads queue and process when online
- [ ] Supports JPG and PNG formats

**Technical Tasks:**

1. **Update MessageComposerView.swift** (~80 lines):
   - Add `@Binding var selectedImage: UIImage?` parameter
   - Add `@State private var showImagePicker = false`
   - Add "+" button (left of text field) to open photo picker
   - Add `imagePreviewView()` showing thumbnail + file size + X button
   - Update `isSendDisabled` logic: allow send if text OR image present
   - Add `.sheet(isPresented: $showImagePicker) { ImagePicker(image: $selectedImage) }`

2. **Update MessageThreadView.swift** (~15 lines):
   - Add `@State private var selectedImage: UIImage?`
   - Pass `selectedImage: $selectedImage` to MessageComposerView
   - Update `sendMessage()` to accept optional image parameter
   - Clear `selectedImage = nil` after sending (optimistic UI)

3. **Update MessageThreadViewModel.swift** (~120 lines):
   - Update `sendMessage(text:image:)` signature to accept `UIImage?`
   - Create AttachmentEntity if image provided
   - Save image to temporary directory: `saveImageToTemporaryDirectory()`
   - Insert AttachmentEntity into SwiftData with `uploadStatus: .pending`
   - Sync message text to RTDB immediately (fast path)
   - Background task: `uploadAttachment()` to Firebase Storage
   - Update RTDB with attachment URL after upload completes
   - Handle upload failures: mark attachment as failed, show retry

4. **Update MessageService.swift** (~25 lines):
   - Add `updateMessageAttachment()` method
   - Writes to RTDB: `/messages/{conversationID}/{messageID}/attachment`
   - Payload: `{ url: string, type: "image", uploadedAt: timestamp }`
   - Update RTDB listener to sync attachment URLs back to SwiftData

**Testing Standards:**

**Manual Testing:**
- [ ] Tap "+" button ‚Üí iOS photo picker opens
- [ ] Select photo ‚Üí thumbnail appears with file size
- [ ] Tap X on thumbnail ‚Üí photo removed
- [ ] Send photo only (no text) ‚Üí message sends with "[Photo]" placeholder
- [ ] Send text + photo ‚Üí both visible in message
- [ ] Slow network ‚Üí upload progress bar shows 0-100%
- [ ] Turn off WiFi mid-upload ‚Üí upload fails, retry button shows
- [ ] Tap retry ‚Üí upload resumes and completes
- [ ] Offline test: attach photo, turn off WiFi, send ‚Üí queues locally
- [ ] Turn on WiFi ‚Üí attachment uploads automatically

**Integration Testing:**
- [ ] Cross-device: Device A sends photo ‚Üí Device B receives
- [ ] Large photo (5MB+) ‚Üí compresses to <2MB before upload
- [ ] Corrupt image file ‚Üí error toast with specific message
- [ ] Network timeout ‚Üí retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] Low storage space ‚Üí warning alert before upload

**References:**
- PRD Epic 2: One-on-One Chat (Story 2.4 - Image Attachments)
- Existing: GroupCreationView.swift (ImagePicker usage pattern)
- Existing: StorageService.uploadImage()
- Implementation Plan: See detailed breakdown above

### Story 3.12: Display Image Attachments in Message Bubbles
**As a user, I want to see images in message bubbles so I can view shared photos.**

**Priority:** P0 (MVP Blocker)
**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes
**Complexity:** Medium (UI rendering + interaction)

**Gap Analysis:**
- ‚ùå **Current:** MessageBubbleView only renders `message.text` (line 82)
- ‚ùå **Current:** Ignores `message.attachments` array entirely
- üìä **Impact:** Even if backend supported images, UI cannot display them

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Image attachments render in message bubble above text
- [ ] Images load asynchronously with "Loading..." placeholder
- [ ] Tap image opens full-screen ImageViewerView
- [ ] Images scale proportionally (max width 75% of screen, max height 300pt)
- [ ] Failed image loads show error icon + "Retry Download" button
- [ ] Long press image (own messages) shows read receipts sheet
- [ ] Upload progress overlay shows percentage (0-100%) while uploading
- [ ] Supports offline cached images (loads from localURL if url unavailable)
- [ ] Full-screen viewer supports pinch-to-zoom (1x-4x), swipe-down to dismiss

**Technical Tasks:**

1. **Update MessageBubbleView.swift** (~120 lines):
   - Add `@State private var showImageViewer = false`
   - Add `@State private var imageToView: String?`
   - Update `regularMessageView` to render images before text
   - Create `imageAttachmentView()` method:
     - AsyncImage with loading/success/failure states
     - Loading: Gray placeholder + ProgressView
     - Success: Image with maxWidth 75%, maxHeight 300, rounded corners
     - Failure: Error icon + retry button
   - Add `.onTapGesture { showImageViewer = true }` to image
   - Add `.fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showImageViewer) { ImageViewerView() }`
   - Show upload progress overlay if `attachment.uploadStatus == .uploading`

2. **Create ImageViewerView.swift** (NEW FILE, ~110 lines):
   - Full-screen black background
   - AsyncImage with loading/error states
   - Close button (top-right X)
   - Pinch-to-zoom gesture (1x-4x zoom range)
   - Double-tap to reset zoom
   - Swipe down gesture to dismiss
   - `.statusBar(hidden: true)` for immersive viewing

3. **Update MessageThreadViewModel.swift** (~15 lines):
   - Update `retryFailedMessage()` to handle attachment retries
   - If message has failed attachment, call `uploadAttachment()` again
   - Reset attachment status: `uploadStatus = .pending`

**Testing Standards:**

**Manual Testing:**
- [ ] Receive message with image ‚Üí image renders in bubble
- [ ] Image loads async ‚Üí placeholder shows ‚Üí image appears
- [ ] Tap image ‚Üí full-screen viewer opens
- [ ] In viewer: pinch to zoom ‚Üí scales 1x-4x
- [ ] In viewer: double-tap ‚Üí resets zoom to 1x
- [ ] In viewer: swipe down ‚Üí dismisses to chat
- [ ] In viewer: tap X button ‚Üí dismisses to chat
- [ ] Upload progress: send image on slow network ‚Üí shows 0-100% overlay
- [ ] Failed load: broken URL ‚Üí error icon + "Retry Download" button
- [ ] Long press image (own message) ‚Üí read receipts sheet opens

**Accessibility Testing:**
- [ ] VoiceOver: "Image attachment. Tap to view full screen."
- [ ] Dynamic Type: Image scales with text size preferences
- [ ] High Contrast: Image borders visible in high contrast mode

**Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Very tall image (portrait 9:16) ‚Üí constrains to maxHeight 300
- [ ] Very wide image (panorama 3:1) ‚Üí constrains to maxWidth 75%
- [ ] Corrupt image file ‚Üí shows error state with retry
- [ ] Offline cached image ‚Üí loads from localURL
- [ ] Multiple attachments ‚Üí only first shown (future: carousel)
