# Story 5.5: Creator Inbox View

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As** Andrew (the creator),
**I want** to see all my fan DMs in one dedicated inbox,
**so that** I can efficiently manage fan communication (and later use AI features).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Creator sees "Inbox" tab with all fan DM conversations
2. Inbox shows only DM conversations (no group chats/channels)
3. Conversations are sorted by most recent message first
4. Unread badge count displays on Inbox tab
5. Each conversation row shows fan name, last message preview, timestamp
6. Tapping conversation opens message thread
7. Fans see "DMs" tab showing their conversation with Andrew only
8. Fan DM tab shows single conversation (or empty state if no DM yet)
9. Inbox view is only visible to creator (not fans)
10. Real-time updates when new fan messages arrive

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Inbox View Structure:**
```swift
struct InboxView: View {
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
    @Query(
        filter: #Predicate<ConversationEntity> { conversation in
            !conversation.isGroup
        },
        sort: \ConversationEntity.lastMessageAt,
        order: .reverse
    ) private var dmConversations: [ConversationEntity]

    var totalUnread: Int {
        dmConversations.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.unreadCount }
    }

    var body: some View {
        List(dmConversations) { conversation in
            ConversationRowView(conversation: conversation)
                .onTapGesture {
                    // Navigate to MessageThreadView
                }
        }
        .navigationTitle("Inbox")
        .badge(totalUnread)
    }
}
```

**Fan DM View:**
```swift
struct FanDMView: View {
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
    @Query private var conversations: [ConversationEntity]

    var andrewConversation: ConversationEntity? {
        conversations.first { conversation in
            !conversation.isGroup &&
            conversation.participantIDs.contains(AppConstants.CREATOR_ID)
        }
    }

    var body: some View {
        if let conversation = andrewConversation {
            // Show conversation with Andrew
            NavigationLink(value: conversation) {
                ConversationRowView(conversation: conversation)
            }
        } else {
            // Empty state with "Message Andrew" button
            EmptyDMView()
        }
    }
}
```

**Tab Bar Conditional Display:**
```swift
TabView {
    ChannelsView()
        .tabItem { Label("Channels", systemImage: "bubble.left.and.bubble.right") }

    if currentUser.isCreator {
        InboxView()
            .tabItem { Label("Inbox", systemImage: "tray") }
            .badge(inboxUnreadCount)
    } else {
        FanDMView()
            .tabItem { Label("DMs", systemImage: "message") }
    }

    ProfileView()
        .tabItem { Label("Profile", systemImage: "person.circle") }
}
```

### Inbox Features
- **Sorting:** Most recent message first (real-time)
- **Filtering:** DMs only (isGroup = false)
- **Unread Count:** Sum of all DM unread counts
- **Real-time:** Auto-updates via @Query SwiftData
- **Navigation:** Tap → MessageThreadView (existing)

### UI Components to Reuse
- ✅ ConversationRowView (from Epic 2)
- ✅ MessageThreadView (from Epic 2)
- ✅ Message bubbles and composer (from Epic 2)
- ✅ TabView structure (existing)

### Future AI Integration (Epic 6)
This inbox view is designed to support AI features:
- Auto-categorization of DMs
- Smart reply suggestions
- Sentiment analysis
- Priority sorting
- Business opportunity detection

### Dependencies
- **Depends on:** Epic 2 (One-on-One Chat) - DM infrastructure
- **Depends on:** Story 5.2 (User Type) - Creator identification
- **Depends on:** Story 5.4 (DM Restrictions) - Ensures only valid DMs
- **Enables:** Epic 6 (AI Features) - Inbox is foundation for AI
