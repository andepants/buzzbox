# Story 5.6: Simplified Navigation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** clear and intuitive navigation,
**so that** I can easily access channels, DMs, and my profile.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Fans see 3 tabs: Channels | DMs | Profile
2. Creator sees 3 tabs: Channels | Inbox | Profile (Settings tab deferred)
3. Tab bar is conditional based on userType
4. "New Group" button is removed (channels are pre-created)
5. "Message Andrew" button is accessible for fans in multiple locations
6. Primary "Message Andrew" location: Empty state in FanDMView
7. Secondary location: Floating action button (FAB) in ChannelsView
8. Tab icons are clear and appropriate (SF Symbols)
9. Active tab is visually distinct
10. Navigation is consistent throughout the app
11. Deep linking works for push notifications
12. Tab selection persists across app restarts

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Tab Bar Structure:**
```swift
struct MainTabView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var authService: AuthService
    @AppStorage("selectedTab") private var selectedTab = 0

    var currentUser: UserEntity? {
        authService.currentUser
    }

    var body: some View {
        TabView(selection: $selectedTab) {
            // Tab 1: Channels (Everyone)
            NavigationStack {
                ChannelsView()
            }
            .tabItem {
                Label("Channels", systemImage: "bubble.left.and.bubble.right")
            }
            .tag(0)

            // Tab 2: Inbox (Creator) or DMs (Fan)
            NavigationStack {
                if currentUser?.isCreator == true {
                    InboxView()
                } else {
                    FanDMView()
                }
            }
            .tabItem {
                Label(
                    currentUser?.isCreator == true ? "Inbox" : "DMs",
                    systemImage: currentUser?.isCreator == true ? "tray" : "message"
                )
            }
            .badge(inboxUnreadCount)
            .tag(1)

            // Tab 3: Profile (Everyone)
            NavigationStack {
                ProfileView()
            }
            .tabItem {
                Label("Profile", systemImage: "person.circle")
            }
            .tag(2)
        }
    }
}
```

**Tab Icons (SF Symbols):**
- Channels: `bubble.left.and.bubble.right` or `number.square`
- Inbox (Creator): `tray` or `envelope`
- DMs (Fan): `message` or `bubble.left.and.bubble.right.fill`
- Profile: `person.circle` or `person.crop.circle`
- Message Andrew FAB: `paperplane.fill`

**Deep Linking Handler:**
```swift
struct BuzzboxApp: App {
    @StateObject private var authService = AuthService.shared

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MainTabView()
                .environmentObject(authService)
                .onOpenURL { url in
                    handleDeepLink(url)
                }
        }
    }

    func handleDeepLink(_ url: URL) {
        // Parse URL and navigate to conversation
        // e.g., buzzbox://conversation/{conversationId}
    }
}
```

### User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity:** Minimal tabs, clear purpose for each
- **Clarity:** Tab labels and icons are self-explanatory
- **Efficiency:** Quick access to main features
- **Context-Aware:** Different navigation for creator vs fans
- **Consistency:** Same patterns throughout app

### Navigation Patterns
- **TabView:** Main app navigation (bottom tabs)
- **NavigationStack:** Within-tab navigation (push/pop)
- **Sheet:** Modals for settings, profile edit
- **Alert:** Confirmations, errors
- **Toast:** Quick feedback (using PopupView)

### Dependencies
- **Depends on:** Story 5.2 (User Type) - Conditional tabs
- **Depends on:** Story 5.3 (Channel System) - Channels tab
- **Depends on:** Story 5.5 (Creator Inbox) - Inbox/DM tabs
- **Completes:** Epic 5 - Final piece of architecture pivot

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Manual testing on simulator and device
- Test with both fan and creator accounts
- Test tab switching and navigation
- Verify persistence across app restarts
- Test deep linking from notifications

### Test Cases

1. **Fan Tab Bar:**
   - Login as fan
   - Verify 3 tabs visible: Channels | DMs | Profile
   - Check tab icons are correct
   - Verify tab labels match expected text
   - No Settings tab visible

2. **Creator Tab Bar:**
   - Login as Andrew (creator)
   - Verify 3 tabs visible: Channels | Inbox | Profile
   - Settings tab may be visible (future)
   - Check tab icons are correct
   - Inbox shows unread badge if applicable

3. **Tab Selection:**
   - Tap each tab
   - Verify correct view displays
   - Check active tab is visually highlighted
   - Tap same tab again (should scroll to top if applicable)

4. **Tab Persistence:**
   - Select tab 2 (DMs/Inbox)
   - Force quit app
   - Relaunch app
   - Verify tab 2 is still selected

5. **Message Andrew Button (Fans):**
   - Login as fan
   - Navigate to Profile or DMs tab
   - Find "Message Andrew" button
   - Tap button
   - Verify DM with Andrew opens or is created

6. **No New Group Button:**
   - Navigate to Channels tab
   - Verify no "New Group" or "+" button exists
   - Confirm channels cannot be created by users
   - Only pre-seeded channels visible

7. **Navigation Consistency:**
   - Navigate from Channels → Channel thread
   - Use back button → returns to Channels
   - Navigate from Inbox → Message thread
   - Use back button → returns to Inbox
   - Verify navigation stack behaves correctly

8. **Deep Linking:**
   - Receive push notification for new message
   - Tap notification
   - App opens to correct conversation
   - Correct tab is selected
   - Conversation is visible

9. **Unread Badges:**
   - Have unread messages in DMs/Inbox
   - Check badge appears on DMs/Inbox tab
   - Badge shows correct count
   - Open conversation
   - Badge decreases or disappears

10. **User Type Switching:**
    - Login as fan
    - Verify fan tabs
    - Logout
    - Login as creator
    - Verify creator tabs
    - Check no visual glitches

11. **Edge Cases:**
    - Delete all conversations
    - Verify empty states in each tab
    - Create new conversation
    - Verify tab updates
    - Test with slow network
