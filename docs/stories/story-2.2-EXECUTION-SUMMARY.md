## Code Quality

### Metrics:
- ✅ All files under 500 lines (largest: 253 lines)
- ✅ Swift doc comments on all public APIs
- ✅ MARK: sections for organization
- ✅ Descriptive variable names
- ✅ No emoji in code
- ✅ Swift 6 strict concurrency compliant

## Known Issues & Follow-ups

### Minor TODOs:
1. **Recipient name search** (line 45 ConversationListView.swift)
   - Currently searches by message content only
   - Recipient name filtering needs async loading completion
   - **Impact:** Low
   - **Recommendation:** Complete in Story 2.3 or 2.4

### Dependencies:
- Story 2.3 required for MessageThreadView navigation (currently placeholder)

2. ⚠️ **Recommended:** Test on physical device for network monitoring
3. ✅ **Optional:** Add conversation deletion confirmation alert

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ Story 2.2 marked complete
2. → Proceed to **Story 2.3: Send and Receive Messages**
3. → Complete recipient name search TODO in follow-up
