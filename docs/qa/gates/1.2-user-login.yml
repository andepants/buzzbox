# Risk Assessment
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 0
    high: 1    # Build blocker
    medium: 2  # Rate limiting, integration tests

  highest:
    risk: "Build Blocker + Missing Security Rate Limiting"
    score: 7   # High * Medium = 7 (triggers CONCERNS)
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Resolve Xcode project duplicate GoogleService-Info.plist (BUILD-001)"

# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Excellent Keychain implementation with proper access control. Comprehensive error handling. CONCERN: No client-side rate limiting for login attempts. Firebase provides server-side protection but client-side throttling would improve UX and security."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper async/await usage, non-blocking operations, efficient SwiftData upsert pattern. Cannot verify < 2s target without integration test but architecture is sound."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, prevents double-submission, graceful Keychain failures. Loading states properly managed."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation with Swift doc comments. Clear MARK sections. Files under 500 lines. Proper separation of concerns. Code is AI-friendly and follows project conventions."

# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Gate Status: CONCERNS

  This story demonstrates solid engineering fundamentals with excellent code quality,
  comprehensive documentation, and outstanding Keychain test coverage. The architecture
  properly follows the offline-first SwiftData pattern with Firebase sync.

  CONCERNS raised due to:
  1. BUILD-001 (High): Xcode build blocker prevents verification on simulator
  2. TEST-001 (Medium): Missing integration test for critical auth flow
  3. SEC-001 (Medium): No client-side rate limiting for login attempts

  The implementation is production-ready from a code quality perspective, but requires:
  - Immediate: Fix Xcode project configuration
  - Immediate: Add Firebase Auth integration test
  - Recommended: Consider rate limiting for improved security/UX

  All acceptance criteria are implemented except navigation (blocked by Story 2.2).
  Core security is solid with proper Keychain usage. Missing features are polish items
  that can be addressed before production but don't block story completion.

  Recommendation: APPROVE with required fixes for BUILD-001 and TEST-001.

# Next Steps
next_steps:
  for_dev:
    - "Fix Xcode project duplicate GoogleService-Info.plist reference"
    - "Run full test suite and verify all tests pass"
    - "Add integration test for Firebase Auth login flow"
    - "Manual test on physical device with real Firebase project"
    - "Update story File List if any files were modified during QA"

  for_qa:
    - "Re-review after BUILD-001 and TEST-001 are resolved"
    - "Verify integration tests pass with Firebase emulator"
    - "Manual testing: Login with valid credentials"
    - "Manual testing: Login with invalid credentials"
    - "Manual testing: iOS autofill functionality"
    - "Manual testing: Accessibility with VoiceOver"

  for_po:
    - "Decide if rate limiting is required for MVP or can defer to future sprint"
    - "Decide if missing polish items (haptics, shake animation) are MVP blockers"
