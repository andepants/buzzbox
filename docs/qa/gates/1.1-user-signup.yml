gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Code quality is excellent with comprehensive validation and tests, but deployment is blocked by Xcode project configuration. Additionally, missing integration tests for Firebase operations and error recovery scenarios."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SecureField used for passwords, validation in place, no password logging. AuthError enum provides user-friendly messages without leaking details. Display name uniqueness enforced."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Debounced displayName availability check (500ms) prevents excessive Firestore queries. @MainActor properly used for UI thread safety."

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Good error mapping from Firebase errors to AuthError. However, missing rollback logic for partial failures (e.g., if user created in Auth but Firestore write fails). No retry mechanism for network errors."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code documentation with /// Swift doc comments. Clean separation of concerns (User struct vs UserEntity SwiftData model). Files under 250 lines each. Clear naming conventions."

  - "Accessibility labels and iOS best practices followed in UI"
  - "Debounced availability checking prevents excessive queries"
  - "Error handling with user-friendly messages"

areas_for_improvement:
  - "Add integration tests for Firebase operations"
