# Quality Gate Decision - Story 3.7
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect) - BMAD™ Core

# Required fields
schema: 1
story: "3.7"
story_title: "Send FCM Notifications for Group Messages"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is functionally complete and well-coded, but lacks automated tests for critical push notification functionality. Manual testing is acceptable for MVP, but integration tests should be added in a future sprint."

# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Cloud Functions run with admin privileges (secure). FCM tokens properly stored. No sensitive data in payload."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Uses sendEachForMulticast for efficiency. Could optimize token fetching with Promise.all for large groups."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No automated tests. No retry logic for failed FCM sends. Manual testing only."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-documented code. Clear separation of concerns. Follows best practices."
