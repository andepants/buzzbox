# Quality Gate Decision - Story 2.8
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "2.8"
story_title: "User Presence & Online Status"
gate: BLOCKED
status_reason: "Implementation contains CRITICAL security vulnerabilities that prevent deployment. Missing userPresence security rules and wide-open database permissions expose all users to impersonation and data corruption risks. Code architecture is excellent, but security issues must be resolved immediately."
