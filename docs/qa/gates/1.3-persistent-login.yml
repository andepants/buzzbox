        Story AC #1 states: "On app launch, check for valid auth token in Keychain"
        Implementation checks: "Auth.auth().currentUser" (Firebase built-in persistence)

        Firebase Auth automatically persists sessions to disk (UserDefaults + Keychain).
        Current implementation relies on Firebase SDK instead of explicit Keychain check.

        Options:
        1. Accept deviation - Firebase persistence is secure and simpler
        2. Require Keychain-first - align with spec, more control over persistence

        Impact: If Keychain-first required, AuthViewModel.checkAuthStatus() needs refactor

  - "Token refresh logic with 1-hour threshold is sensible"

# Code Quality Concerns
concerns:
  - "Duplicate AuthViewModel instances will cause state synchronization issues"
  - "Firebase built-in persistence differs from documented Keychain-first approach"
  - "No tests to verify critical auto-login behavior"

# Architecture Analysis
architecture_review:
  pattern_adherence: CONCERNS
  notes: |
    Story specifies: Check Keychain → autoLogin() → Verify with Firebase
    Implementation does: Check Firebase.currentUser → Verify token → Update Keychain

    The implementation inverts the flow to rely on Firebase SDK's built-in persistence
    instead of Keychain as the source of truth. This works and may be simpler, but
    deviates from the documented architecture pattern.

    AuthService.autoLogin(modelContext:) exists and follows the spec (lines 306-385)
    but AuthViewModel.checkAuthStatus() bypasses it in favor of direct Firebase check.

    Concerns:
    1. Inconsistent with offline-first philosophy (Keychain should be source of truth)
    2. Creates two different auto-login code paths (confusing)
    3. Bypasses SwiftData sync that autoLogin() provides

    Recommendation: PO decision required on acceptable architecture pattern.

  state_management: FAIL
  notes: |
    Critical issue: Duplicate AuthViewModel instances
    - RootView.swift line 14: @StateObject private var authViewModel = AuthViewModel()
    - buzzboxApp.swift line 26: @StateObject private var authViewModel = AuthViewModel()
    - RootView.swift line 29: .environmentObject(authViewModel)  (but uses its own @StateObject)

    This creates two separate instances with separate state:
    - App-level ViewModel tracks auth state
    - RootView-level ViewModel tracks different auth state
    - LoginView receives app-level via @EnvironmentObject

    Result: State synchronization issues, unpredictable behavior

    Fix: RootView should use @EnvironmentObject to receive app-level instance

  dependency_injection: PASS
  notes: "AuthService properly injected into AuthViewModel with default value. ModelContext passed correctly."

# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Gate Status: FAIL

  This story cannot pass QA review due to multiple critical blockers:

  CRITICAL BLOCKERS (P0):
  1. BUILD-001: Duplicate GoogleService-Info.plist prevents builds - HARD BLOCKER
     - Cannot run app in simulator or device
     - Cannot perform any manual testing
     - Cannot verify any acceptance criteria
     - Zero test execution possible

  2. IMPL-001: Duplicate AuthViewModel instances - ARCHITECTURE FLAW
     - RootView creates its own @StateObject instead of using @EnvironmentObject
     - Creates two separate state machines that will desynchronize
     - Will cause unpredictable auth state behavior
     - MUST FIX before testing - even with working build, this breaks functionality

  3. TEST-001: Zero tests for auto-login functionality - QUALITY GATE FAILURE
     - No unit tests for AuthViewModel.checkAuthStatus()
     - No unit tests for AuthService.autoLogin() or refreshAuthIfNeeded()
     - No integration tests for complete flow
     - Cannot verify acceptance criteria programmatically
     - High risk of regression

  MAJOR CONCERNS (P1):
  4. ARCH-001: Implementation deviates from story specification
     - Spec says: "Check Keychain for valid auth token on launch"
     - Code does: "Check Firebase.auth().currentUser"
     - Creates inconsistent architecture (autoLogin() exists but unused)
     - Bypasses SwiftData sync that autoLogin() provides
     - PO DECISION REQUIRED: Accept deviation or require alignment?

  5. AC-001: Cannot verify any of 9 acceptance criteria
     - All blocked by build failure
     - No test coverage to verify programmatically
     - Manual testing impossible

  POSITIVE ASPECTS:
  - Code quality is excellent where it exists
  - File documentation comprehensive
  - Privacy overlay properly implemented
  - Loading states handled correctly
  - Token refresh logic appears sound
  - Follows Swift 6 and SwiftUI best practices

  RECOMMENDATION: REJECT - Fix P0 blockers and re-submit

  Required fixes before re-review:
  1. Fix Xcode project duplicate GoogleService-Info.plist (5 min)
  2. Fix duplicate AuthViewModel - use @EnvironmentObject in RootView (2 min)
  3. Add unit tests for auto-login functionality (2 hours)
  4. PO decision on architecture deviation (0 min decision, potentially 30 min refactor)
  5. Build successfully and verify all ACs manually (30 min)

  Estimated time to resolve: 3-4 hours + PO decision

  This is NOT a code quality issue - the code is well-written. This is a
  completeness and testing issue that must be resolved before production.
