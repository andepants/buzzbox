# Quality Gate Decision: Story 3.1 - Create Group Conversation
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)
# Date: 2025-10-22

schema: 1
story: "3.1"
story_title: "Create Group Conversation with Participants"
gate: FAIL
status_reason: "Critical security infrastructure missing. RTDB security rules for /conversations and Firebase Storage rules must be implemented before production deployment. Implementation quality is excellent, but missing security rules create data integrity and authorization vulnerabilities."

# Critical Issues Blocking Gate
top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Firebase RTDB security rules missing for /conversations/{conversationId} path"
    impact: "Without security rules, all conversation writes fail due to default deny rule. No participant validation, admin authorization, or data integrity checks enforced server-side."
    suggested_action: "Add RTDB rules for conversation metadata (read: participants only, write: admins only, validate: min 2 max 256 participants, system messages validated)"
    refs: ["/Users/andre/coding/buzzbox/database.rules.json:19-30"]
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  - id: "SEC-002"
    severity: high
    finding: "Firebase Storage security rules completely missing (no storage.rules file)"
    impact: "Group photo uploads to /group_photos/{groupId}/ have no authentication or file size validation. Potential for unauthorized uploads or abuse."
    suggested_action: "Create storage.rules file with authenticated upload validation, 5MB max file size, image type validation"
    refs: ["/Users/andre/coding/buzzbox/buzzbox/Core/Services/StorageService.swift:67"]
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  - id: "UX-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Photo upload progress bar shows simulated progress, not actual Firebase Storage progress"
    impact: "User sees inaccurate progress for large photo uploads. Upload could stall at 30% while showing completed."
    suggested_action: "Implement actual Firebase Storage progress tracking using uploadTask.observe(.progress) callback"
    refs: ["/Users/andre/coding/buzzbox/buzzbox/Features/Chat/Views/GroupCreationView.swift:304"]
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  - id: "UX-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Photo upload has no cancel button despite AC requirement"
    impact: "Users cannot cancel long-running uploads. Must wait for completion or force-quit app."
    suggested_action: "Add cancel button to progress view, implement uploadTask cancellation"
    refs: ["/Users/andre/coding/buzzbox/buzzbox/Features/Chat/Views/GroupCreationView.swift:122-129"]
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  - id: "UX-003"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Photo upload failure shows error alert but no retry capability"
    impact: "User must recreate entire group (re-enter name, re-select participants) to retry failed upload."
    suggested_action: "Decouple photo upload from group creation. Allow group creation to succeed even if photo upload fails, with retry button for photo only."

# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "Critical: RTDB security rules missing for /conversations path. Firebase Storage rules missing entirely. Client-side validation exists but server-side enforcement required."

  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Image compression implemented properly (2048x2048, 500KB target). Photo upload progress simulated not real. ParticipantPickerView loads all users at once (no pagination). Acceptable for MVP but needs improvement for scale."

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Offline queue implemented with syncStatus. Photo upload failure has no retry - user must recreate entire group. Network error handling is basic with generic messages."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization, documentation, file structure. All files under 500 lines. Components properly reusable. Follows project architecture patterns."

        - Write access: auth.uid in data.child('adminUserIDs')
        - Validate: participantIDs.length >= 2 && <= 256
        - Validate: system messages require senderID == 'system' if isSystemMessage == true

# Compliance Check

# Gate Decision Logic
decision_logic: |
  Gate set to FAIL due to 2 CRITICAL security issues:
  1. SEC-001: RTDB security rules missing for /conversations path (probability: HIGH, impact: HIGH)
  2. SEC-002: Firebase Storage security rules missing entirely (probability: HIGH, impact: HIGH)

  Without these rules:
  - All conversation writes will FAIL (default deny rule)
  - No server-side validation of participant limits, admin permissions
  - Photo uploads have no authentication or file size enforcement

  3 MEDIUM issues identified for post-MVP improvement (UX-001, UX-002, UX-003).

  Implementation quality is EXCELLENT. Code is well-structured, documented, and follows
  all project patterns. Once security rules are added, gate will move to PASS or CONCERNS
  depending on UX issues prioritization.
