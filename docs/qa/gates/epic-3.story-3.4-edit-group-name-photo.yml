    title: 'Duplicate photo upload logic (Non-Blocking)'
    description: 'EditGroupInfoView reimplements photo upload with progress tracking (lines 327-385) instead of using StorageService.uploadGroupPhoto(). Root cause: StorageService.uploadGroupPhoto() does not support progress callbacks. Both implementations work correctly with identical compression logic.'

# Additional Notes
notes: |
  **FINAL APPROVAL - Story 3.4 is PRODUCTION-READY**

  This is an excellent implementation with 100% acceptance criteria coverage. The story demonstrates:
  - Professional-grade Swift 6 concurrency practices
  - Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive error recovery with retry mechanism (AC #11 fully implemented)
  - Maintainable code with constants extraction and clear documentation
  - Strong security posture with admin-only enforcement and input validation

  **What was fixed in final review:**
  - ✅ AC #11: Retry button fully implemented with comprehensive error recovery
  - ✅ Constants extraction: Magic numbers removed, maintainability improved
  - ✅ Error state management: Proper cleanup and reset logic

  **Remaining technical debt (NON-BLOCKING for MVP):**
  - Duplicate photo upload logic (both implementations work correctly, post-MVP refactoring)
  - Generic error handling (functional, can be enhanced with specific Firebase error parsing)
  - Minor MIME validation concern (low-risk, ImagePicker returns valid UIImages)

  **Recommendation:** APPROVE for production. Move story to Done status immediately.

  The minor technical debt items are tracked for post-MVP improvements but do not impact
  functionality, security, or user experience. This implementation exceeds MVP requirements.
